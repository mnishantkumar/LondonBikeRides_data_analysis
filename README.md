# London Bike Rides Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes bike ride trends in London, focusing on patterns of usage over time and across different conditions. Using data from the London bike sharing system, we apply statistical methods and visualization techniques to uncover insights into ride frequencies, effects of weather conditions on bike usage, and more.

## Components
- **London Bike Rides - Moving Average and Heatmap.twbx**: A Tableau workbook presenting visual analysis.
- **london_merged.csv**: The main dataset, including timestamps, weather conditions, and the number of bike shares.
- **london_bikes_final.xlsx**: An Excel workbook used for preliminary data analysis and cleaning.
- **london_bikes.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook detailing the data analysis process, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- **london-bike-sharing-dataset.zip**: The raw dataset archive.

## Data Source
The data encompasses bike sharing information in London, including ride durations, weather conditions, and holiday information, aiming to identify patterns and correlations.

## How to Use
1. **Data Exploration**: Start with the Jupyter notebook (`london_bikes.ipynb`) for an overview of the data cleaning and exploration process.
